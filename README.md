# Small C-like Programming Language Compiler

This project involves creating a small programming language compiler for a language called Small C-like Programming Language. The compiler consists of several components, including a lexer, parser, BNF rules, and an evaluator. The goal is to implement these components in Java to enable the evaluation of expressions, functions, loops, and logic statements in the Small C-like Programming Language.

## Components

The main components of the Small C-like Programming Language compiler are as follows:

1. **Lexer**: The lexer is responsible for tokenizing the source code input. It scans the source code and breaks it down into a sequence of tokens. Tokens represent the smallest meaningful units in the language, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals. The lexer outputs a list of tokens along with their corresponding token names, data, and positions.

2. **Parser**: The parser takes the list of tokens produced by the lexer and applies BNF rules to parse the input. It verifies the syntax of the program according to the grammar defined by the BNF rules. If the syntax is correct, the parser constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that represents the structure and semantics of the program.

3. **Evaluator**: The evaluator traverses the AST generated by the parser and performs the evaluation of expressions, functions, loops, and statements. It interprets the program and executes the code accordingly. The evaluator also maintains a state, represented by the State class, which stores the values of variables encountered during program execution.

4. **State Class**: The State class stores the identifiers and values of variables encountered during program execution. It maintains a mapping of variable names to their corresponding values. For each variable, there is a stack of values to handle scoping. The State class allows access to the variable values and provides a mechanism to print all the values at the end of the program.

## Execution Flow

The execution flow of the Small C-like Programming Language compiler is as follows:

1. The program's entry point is the `main` function of the Driver class, which is responsible for initializing the compiler components and defining a sample program input.

2. The lexer receives the sample program source code as input and tokenizes it, producing a list of tokens with their respective names, data, and positions.

3. The parser takes the list of tokens and applies BNF rules to parse the program's syntax. If the syntax is incorrect, the parser throws an exception indicating a syntax error.

4. If the syntax is correct, the parser generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing the program's structure and semantics.

5. The evaluator receives the AST from the parser and performs the evaluation of expressions, functions, loops, and statements according to the program's logic. During execution, the evaluator maintains the state of the program in the State class, storing the values of variables encountered.

6. If the evaluator encounters an exception, such as division by zero or any other evaluation error, it raises an exception indicating the cause of the error.

7. After the program finishes execution, the State class contains the values of all the variables encountered during execution. These values are printed to the console.

## Requirements

The Small C-like Programming Language compiler should fulfill the following requirements:

- The program must have a `main` function and include a sample program input for testing purposes.
- The language should support at least three types: `int`, `float`, and `string`.
- The compiler must handle function calls, `if` and `while` statements, assignment, variable declaration, arithmetic, and Boolean operators.
- The compiler should raise appropriate exceptions when errors occur, such as syntax errors or evaluation errors.
- At the end of the program execution, all the values stored in the State class should be printed.

## Usage

To run the Small C-like Programming Language compiler, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.

2. Compile the Java source code files using a Java compiler:

$ javac Lexer.java Parser.java Evaluator.java State.java Driver.java

3. Run the compiled program:

$ java Driver
 
4. The program will execute the sample program input defined in the `main` function and print the resulting values stored in the State class.

Please note that you can modify the sample program input in the `main` function to test different scenarios and features of the Small C-like Programming Language.

## BNF Rules

Please refer to the separate PDF file submitted along with this README for the BNF rules of the Small C-like Programming Language.

---

With this compiler, you can develop programs in the Small C-like Programming Language, evaluate expressions, define functions, use loops and logic statements, and manipulate variables of different types. The compiler will ensure the correctness of the syntax, handle evaluation errors, and provide the values of variables stored in the State class.
